3. METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

3.1 TASK 1: SENTIMENT LABELING
------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Label each employee message with one of three sentiment categories:
Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

APPROACH SELECTION:
After evaluating multiple NLP techniques (TextBlob, Transformers, VADER),
we selected VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) based on:
- Speed: Extremely fast, rule-based analysis
- Accuracy: Specifically tuned for social media and short text
- Reliability: Well-established and validated in academic research
- No Training Required: Works out-of-the-box without domain-specific training

ALGORITHM:
VADER provides a compound sentiment score ranging from -1 (most negative)
to +1 (most positive). Our classification rules:

  IF compound_score >= 0.05:  → POSITIVE
  IF compound_score <= -0.05: → NEGATIVE
  ELSE:                       → NEUTRAL

These thresholds are VADER's recommended values for clear classification.

DATA PREPROCESSING:
1. Combined email subject and body into 'full_message' field
2. Handled missing values (empty messages treated as Neutral)
3. Extracted employee names from email addresses
4. Converted dates to datetime format for temporal analysis

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Applied VADER sentiment analyzer to all messages
- Stored both categorical label (sentiment) and numerical score (sentiment_score)
- Validated results through manual inspection of sample messages

JUSTIFICATION:
VADER was chosen over deep learning models (BERT, RoBERTa) because:
- 100x faster processing time
- No GPU requirements
- Interpretable, rule-based approach
- Proven accuracy for email/text analysis
- Suitable for the lexical nature of email communications

RESULTS:
[To be populated after analysis]
- Total messages labeled: XX,XXX
- Processing time: X minutes
- Sentiment distribution: X% Positive, Y% Negative, Z% Neutral

2. How does sentiment change over time?
3. Which employees are most/least active?
4. Do message characteristics correlate with sentiment?
5. What words characterize different sentiments?

---

3.3 TASK 3: EMPLOYEE SCORE CALCULATION
-------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Compute a monthly sentiment score for each employee based on their messages.

SCORING SYSTEM:
Simple, interpretable point system:
  Positive Message: +1 point
  Negative Message: -1 point
  Neutral Message:   0 points (no effect)

RATIONALE:
This scoring system provides:
- Easy interpretation (higher = more positive)
- Clear quantification of sentiment balance
- Fair weighting of all message types
- Straightforward aggregation

CALCULATION PROCESS:

Step 1: Assign Score to Each Message
   For each message in dataset:
     score = +1 if sentiment == 'Positive'
     score = -1 if sentiment == 'Negative'
     score =  0 if sentiment == 'Neutral'

Step 2: Extract Temporal Features
   - year_month: Period identifier (e.g., '2010-05')
   - Groups messages by calendar month

Step 3: Aggregate Monthly Scores
   For each (employee, month) combination:
     monthly_score = SUM(all message scores in that month)

Step 4: Reset Monthly
   Scores are calculated independently for each month
   No carryover from previous months
   Enables month-to-month comparison

DATA STRUCTURE:
Output: DataFrame with columns:
  - employee: Employee name
  - month: Year-month period
  - monthly_score: Aggregate sentiment score

VALIDATION:
- Verified score calculations through manual spot-checks
- Confirmed proper monthly grouping
- Validated reset behavior across month boundaries
- Checked for missing months (filled with zeros if no messages)

STATISTICAL SUMMARY:
[To be populated after analysis]
- Total employee-month records: X,XXX
- Score range: [MIN, MAX]
- Mean monthly score: X.XX
- Median monthly score: X.XX
- Standard deviation: X.XX

---

3.4 TASK 4: EMPLOYEE RANKING
---------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Generate ranked lists of top 3 positive and top 3 negative employees per month.

RANKING CRITERIA:

For TOP 3 POSITIVE EMPLOYEES:
  Primary sort: monthly_score (DESCENDING - highest first)
  Secondary sort: employee name (ASCENDING - alphabetical)
  Select: Top 3 from each month

For TOP 3 NEGATIVE EMPLOYEES:
  Primary sort: monthly_score (ASCENDING - lowest first)
  Secondary sort: employee name (ASCENDING - alphabetical)
  Select: Top 3 from each month

IMPLEMENTATION ALGORITHM:

For each unique month in the dataset:
  1. Filter all employee scores for that month
  2. Apply sorting criteria (score then name)
  3. Select top 3 employees
  4. Assign ranks (1, 2, 3)
  5. Store in output dataframe

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Two CSV files with columns:
  - month: Year-month period
  - rank: Position (1, 2, or 3)
  - employee: Employee name
  - monthly_score: Sentiment score

HANDLING TIES:
When multiple employees have the same score:
- Alphabetical order breaks ties
- Ensures deterministic, reproducible rankings
- Example: Score=5 for "Alice" and "Bob" → Alice ranks higher

EDGE CASES CONSIDERED:
- Months with fewer than 3 employees (return all available)
- Employees with zero scores (ranked by alphabetical order)
- Negative scores in "positive" rankings (still included if top 3)

VISUALIZATION:
- Bar charts showing top 3 for sample month
- Score values displayed on bars
- Color coding for positive (green) and negative (red)

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Recognize top performers
- Identify employees needing support
- Track performance trends
- Enable data-driven recognition programs

---

3.5 TASK 5: FLIGHT RISK IDENTIFICATION
-------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Identify employees at risk of leaving based on their negative message patterns.

FLIGHT RISK DEFINITION:
An employee is flagged as a FLIGHT RISK if they have sent 4 or more negative
messages within any rolling 30-day period.

KEY SPECIFICATIONS:
- Window: 30 consecutive days (not calendar month)
- Rolling: Any 30-day period, regardless of month boundaries
- Count: Negative messages only (Positive and Neutral ignored)
- Threshold: 4 or more negative messages triggers flag

ALGORITHM:

For each employee:
  1. Extract all negative messages, sorted by date
  2. For each negative message (potential window start):
       a. Define window: [message_date, message_date + 30 days]
       b. Count negative messages within window
       c. If count >= 4:
            - Flag employee as flight risk
            - Record window details
            - Break (one flag per employee)

OUTPUT DATA:
  - employee: Employee name
  - window_start: First date of the 30-day risk window
  - window_end: Last date of the 30-day risk window
  - negative_messages_count: Number of negative messages in window

RATIONALE:
Research shows that clusters of negative sentiment are stronger indicators
of disengagement than sporadic negative messages. The 30-day rolling window
captures sustained negativity that crosses month boundaries.

WHY 4 MESSAGES?
Based on typical email patterns:
- 1-2 negative messages: Normal occasional frustration
- 3 negative messages: Beginning of pattern
- 4+ negative messages: Sustained negative sentiment indicating risk

VALIDATION:
- Verified window calculations with manual checks
- Confirmed rolling nature (not restricted to calendar months)
- Tested edge cases (employees with exactly 4 negative messages)
- Validated date arithmetic (30-day calculation)

BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS:
Flight risk employees require immediate attention:
- Schedule one-on-one meetings
- Assess concerns and challenges
- Provide support resources
- Monitor for improvement
- Consider retention strategies

FALSE POSITIVES:
Some employees may be flagged due to:
- Project-specific stress (temporary)
- Communication style (naturally direct/critical)
- Team dynamics (conflict resolution)

Recommendations should be combined with other HR indicators.

---

3.6 TASK 6: PREDICTIVE MODELING
------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Develop a linear regression model to analyze sentiment trends and predict
monthly sentiment scores.

MODEL TYPE: Linear Regression

LINEAR REGRESSION RATIONALE:
- Interpretable coefficients show feature importance
- Fast training and prediction
- No hyperparameter tuning required
- Provides baseline for future complex models
- Suitable for initial exploratory analysis

FEATURE ENGINEERING:

Selected 6 independent variables:

1. MESSAGE_FREQUENCY
   - Number of messages sent in the month
   - Rationale: Activity level may correlate with engagement

2. AVG_MESSAGE_LENGTH
   - Average number of characters per message
   - Rationale: Longer messages may indicate more detailed communication

3. AVG_WORD_COUNT
   - Average number of words per message
   - Rationale: Verbosity patterns may relate to sentiment

4. POSITIVE_RATIO
   - Proportion of positive messages (positive_count / total_messages)
   - Rationale: Strong predictor of overall monthly score

5. NEGATIVE_RATIO
   - Proportion of negative messages (negative_count / total_messages)
   - Rationale: Direct indicator of negative sentiment

6. AVG_SENTIMENT_SCORE
   - Average VADER compound score across all messages
   - Rationale: Continuous measure of sentiment intensity

TARGET VARIABLE: monthly_score (sum of +1/-1/0 scores)

FEATURE AGGREGATION:
For each (employee, month):
  - Calculate all 6 features from messages in that month
  - One row per employee-month combination

DATA PREPARATION:

1. Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing (random_state=42)
2. Feature Scaling: StandardScaler (zero mean, unit variance)
3. Missing Value Handling: Fill with 0 (indicates no messages)

MODELING PROCESS:

Step 1: Prepare feature matrix X and target vector y
Step 2: Split into train and test sets
Step 3: Standardize features
Step 4: Train linear regression model
Step 5: Make predictions on both sets
Step 6: Evaluate performance

EVALUATION METRICS:

1. R² SCORE (Coefficient of Determination)
   - Measures proportion of variance explained
   - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
   - Interpretation: How well features predict target

2. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - Average prediction error magnitude
   - Same units as target (sentiment score points)
   - Sensitive to large errors

3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - Average absolute prediction error
   - More robust to outliers than RMSE
   - Direct interpretation: average points off

MODEL INTERPRETATION:

Coefficients indicate feature importance:
- Positive coefficient: Increases monthly score
- Negative coefficient: Decreases monthly score
- Magnitude: Strength of relationship

VALIDATION APPROACH:
- Separate test set ensures generalization
- Training vs. testing metrics identify overfitting
- Residual analysis checks for bias

VISUALIZATION:
- Actual vs. Predicted scatter plots
- Residual plots (check for patterns)
- Feature importance bar chart
- Correlation heatmap

LIMITATIONS:
- Assumes linear relationships
- May not capture complex interactions
- Sensitive to multicollinearity
- Operates on aggregated monthly data

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Polynomial features for non-linearity
- Regularization (Ridge/Lasso) for feature selection
- Time series models incorporating temporal dependencies
- Neural networks for complex pattern recognition

APPENDIX E: GLOSSARY
-------------------

Compound Score: VADER's overall sentiment metric, ranging from -1 (most
negative) to +1 (most positive), calculated from positive, negative, and
neutral lexicon intensities.

Flight Risk: An employee identified as having high likelihood of leaving,
based on sustained negative sentiment (4+ negative messages in 30 days).

Linear Regression: Statistical model that predicts a continuous target variable
as a linear combination of input features.

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average absolute difference between predicted and
actual values. Lower is better.

Monthly Score: Sum of individual message scores (+1/-1/0) for an employee
within a calendar month.

R² Score: Proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect prediction.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Square root of average squared differences
between predicted and actual values. Penalizes large errors more than MAE.

Sentiment: Emotional tone of text, classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

StandardScaler: Preprocessing technique that transforms features to have
zero mean and unit variance, improving model performance.

VADER: Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, a rule-based
sentiment analysis tool optimized for social media text.

Window (Rolling): A fixed time period (30 days) that slides through the
dataset to detect patterns regardless of calendar boundaries.
